# Practice Exercise 2

Welcome to this coding exercise. This exercise is intended to improve your understand of what the code team does after writing the initial robot code, and familiarize you with the code base for this year. Although this is our first year doing Java, it is safe to say that the code bases in subsequent years will be similar.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Branch off the `practice-2` branch to create your own working branch.
3. Find all the comments in the code that say `// TODO`. These comments indicate where you need to add code.
<br></br>
When you are done, compare your code to the `main` branch to see the completed code. Note that there are multiple ways to solve each problem, so your solution may differ.
